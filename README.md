# Gym Credit Token System | Group 60

Imagine you run a network of gyms with multiple locations, and your users have ID cards to access
facilities. You're aiming to offer a "Gym Anywhere" experience, where users can visit any branch and use
their credits. However, due to infrastructure or policy limitations, traditional bank transactions aren't
feasible.

You want to build a centralized credit system that:

- Gives users the freedom to access any gym in the network.
- Ensures transparency and prevents misuse of credits.
- Lets users earn, buy, or transfer gym credits securely.
- Can’t be tampered with—even by gym owners.

With blockchain, you can build a secure, fair, and tamper-proof system for managing gym credits. This
project aims to develop a custom ERC-20 token called "Gym Coin (GC)", a smart contract backend, and
a simple frontend interface for users.
